# This folder contains all the necessary code for:
1. Generate random airfoil shapes using bezier curves
2. Interface XFOIL with python
3. Pass the shape files to XFOIL and run simulation in XFOIL, write the results in local directory
4. read the simulation results from local directory and return to the optimization algorithm.
